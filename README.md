# Plant-disease-detection-system-for-sustainable-agriculture-
A plant disease detection system can be implemented using machine learning. Below is a basic Python-based framework using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV for image-based plant disease detection.

Prerequisites

1. Install required libraries:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy scikit-learn


2. Dataset: Obtain a labeled dataset of plant disease images (e.g., from PlantVillage).
   
Steps to Use the Code

1. Replace path_to_dataset with the folder path containing your dataset, organized into subfolders for each class (e.g., Healthy, Diseased).


Notes

Dataset quality: Ensure the dataset is balanced and high-quality for optimal results.

Hyperparameter tuning: Adjust the CNN architecture, learning rate, and epochs based on performance.

Hardware: Use a GPU for faster training, especially for large datasets.
